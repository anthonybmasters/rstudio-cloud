## Purpose

The purpose is to use R to show how the declared aggregate vote share changes progressed throughout election night.
It may be informative to social researchers.

## Data sources

Both of the constituency results come from the House of Commons Library:
- General Election 2017: https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7979
- General Election 2019: https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8749

In the GE2019 file, I formatted the declaration times to 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'.
Both result files were saved as Excel files.
