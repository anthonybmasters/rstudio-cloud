## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is make an animated graph, showing revisions to the ONS modelled incidence rate in England.
This is the daily modelled estimates with 95% credible intervals from the University of Oxford.
This is distinct to the official published estimate of new COVID-19 infections each day.

## Data sources
The source for each series of daily modelled estimates is the Office for National Statistics.
There is an graph of estimated COVID-19 incidence in England in most weekly reports, shown by publication date:
