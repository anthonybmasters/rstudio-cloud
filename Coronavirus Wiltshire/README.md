## Purpose
This R code creates a graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wiltshire, by specimen date.

## Data Sources
I use the confirmed cases by specimen date (pillars 1 and 2), from the Public Health England data dashboard:
- Public Health England: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/downloads/csv/coronavirus-cases_latest.csv

Since this is the latest file, I have also uploaded a copy of the file I used to make the graph.

## R Markdown
There is an R Markdown page to view:
