## Purpose
The purpose is to use R to show vote shares across General Elections between 1918 and 2019.

## Data sources
Both of the data files I used came from the House of Commons Library:
- 1918 to 2017: https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7529
- General Election 2019: https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8749

The combined file is available as an Excel file.

## R Markdown
The R Markdown document, with graphs, is available to view:
