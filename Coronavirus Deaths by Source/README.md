## Purpose
The purpose of this R code to create graphs.
The graphs compare deaths with COVID-19 from two types of sources: statistics offices (ONS and NRS) and public health agencies (PHE, PHW, and PHS).
On the England and Scotland graphs, I use annotations to highlight differences in definitions.

## Data Sources
I have uploaded an Excel data file, containing daily figures (by date of death) from:
- Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending24july2020
- Public Health England: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/deaths?areaType=nation&areaName=England
- Public Health Wales: https://public.tableau.com/profile/public.health.wales.health.protection#!/vizhome/RapidCOVID-19virology-Public/Headlinesummary
