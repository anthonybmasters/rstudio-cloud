## Purpose
The purpose of this R code to create two graphs.
The graphs compare deaths with COVID-19 from two sources: Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics.
PHE also uses figures from Public Health Wales.
On the England graph, I use annotations to highlight differences in definitions.

## Data Sources
I have uploaded an Excel data file, containing daily figures (by date of death) from:
- Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/comparisonofweeklydeathoccurrencesinenglandandwales/uptoweekending10july2020
- Public Health England: https://coronavirus-staging.data.gov.uk/deaths?areaType=nation&areaName=England
