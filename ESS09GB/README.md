## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to compare survey weights. I look at the ninth wave of the European Social Survey in the UK.
The effects of survey weights are looked at for a hypothetical vote intention question on EU membership.
NatCen conducted the survey of 2,204 UK adults (15+). The face-to-face interviews were between 31st August 2018 and 22nd February 2019.
