## Purpose
This code produces graphs showing trends in weekly death registrations in England and Wales.

## Data Sources
For 2010 to 2019, I drew the weekly death registration data from ONS reports. This is collated into a single Excel file:
- Office for National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/weeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales

## R Markdown
An R Markdown document which contains the graphs is available to view:
