## Purpose
The purpose of this R code is to create generalised additive models of UK vote intention.
These models can be used to estimate house effects of polling companies, relative to the industry average.

## Data Sources
Headline vote intentions were drawn from two places:
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election
- BPC member company archives: http://www.britishpollingcouncil.org/officers-members/
