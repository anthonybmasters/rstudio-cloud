## Purpose
This code hosts an analysis of Chicago precincts in the 2020 US Presidiential election.
It shows why we would not expect conformity to the Newcomb-Benford distribution.

## Electoral data
The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners hosted an Excel file, containing results from the 2020 US Presidential elections:
- Chicago BEC: https://chicagoelections.gov/en/election-results-specifics.asp

I produced a flat version of the original export.
